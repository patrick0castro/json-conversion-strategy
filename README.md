# Example of Using the Strategy Design Pattern to Convert JSON

The example project demonstrates the application of the Strategy design pattern for converting data in JSON format to XML and CSV. The Strategy pattern allows defining different conversion strategies and dynamically selecting the correct strategy based on specific needs. This flexible and scalable approach makes it easier to add new conversion formats in the future. The project illustrates the separation of responsibilities, code reuse, and maintenance of a more organized and extensible code when working with different data formats.
